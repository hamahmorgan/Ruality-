# Rurality-
value in and understanding of identities and narratives of rurality

# Counterurbanization of the contemporary 
assumptions in the notion that just because you [one] hasn't witnessed a technology in the urban centre does not mean that it hasn't existed already in rural locations
I [one] could argue that the rural communities have far more advanced skills in inovation and adaptation. Rural intelligence is more includisive and customizable to those who are engaged with it. The rate at which it is accessed also could have a far greater impact. 
How great is a technological advancement when only .5% of your community is able to access or benefit from it - let alone understand it.


# Isolation Myth
never have I felt as isolated in a place than in large urban centers. never have I felt more aware of my differences than when in a place that has sihloed into groups of the same backgound or education or field. 
The anominity you lack in rural locations give you no choice, but to be engaged with the varying ages, professions, and experiences of those around you. 
With so many options in urban centers - People can customize their experience to only their places of comfort. Rarely are they pushed into dicomfort without a specific will to do so. Especially those of priviledge. 
Dicomfort and coming to terms with the lack of control you have over the certain natures of community and human characters is a growing experience that I sense the urban population doesn't have to experience in the same ways.
